Here in this project, I would like to shed some light over Portfolio Optimization and the foundations of Mathematical Optimization and Modern portfolio theory (or Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory). Based on the assumption  that returns are normally distributed and by looking at mean and variance, we can essentially describe the distribution of end-of-period wealth.
The basic idea of this theory is to achieve diversification by constructing a portfolio for a minimal portfolio risk or maximal portfolio returns. Accordingly, the Efficient Frontier is a set of optimal portfolios in the risk-return spectrum, and portfolios located under the Efficient Frontier curve are considered sub-optimal.

## Sections:

### 1.  A Quick Overview of Optimization

- The method of Lagrange
- Lagrange for Single Constraint

### 2. Portfolio Optimisation

- The Mean Variance Criterion
- Markowitz Criterion (continued)
- The Lagrangian Portfolio Optimisation
- Monte Carlo Approach

### 3. The Optimisation Class

### 4. Conclusions

Below I included the Plotly charts that could not be loaded into the Jupyter due to their file size:
