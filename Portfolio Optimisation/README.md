# Portfolio Optimisation

Here in this project, I would like to shed some light over Portfolio Optimization and the foundations of Mathematical Optimization and Modern portfolio theory (or Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory). Based on the assumption  that returns are normally distributed and by looking at mean and variance, we can essentially describe the distribution of end-of-period wealth.
The basic idea of this theory is to achieve diversification by constructing a portfolio for a minimal portfolio risk or maximal portfolio returns. Accordingly, the Efficient Frontier is a set of optimal portfolios in the risk-return spectrum, and portfolios located under the Efficient Frontier curve are considered sub-optimal.
